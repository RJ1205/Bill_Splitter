This is the *Bill Splitter* project I made myself.


<p>Eating out with friends is fun, but splitting the bill can be tricky. This project helps you develop a Python-based tool to easily divide restaurant bills equally. Input the number of friends and the total bill amount, and the app calculates each person's share. No more awkward calculations or uneven splits!<br>
The app handles cases where someone is feeling generous and wants to be the "lucky one" and not contribute to the bill. This makes dining out more enjoyable for everyone. Users can input friend's names, and the app displays a clear breakdown of individual contributions. This project is designed to keep the focus on the fun, not the finances.</p>
